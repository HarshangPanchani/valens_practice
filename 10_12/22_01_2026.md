Understanding from Today’s Meeting:

•   VPN setup is needede for static ip so that there will not be multiple records in firewall
•   Explain ideas and road map with proposal architecture
•   Repos: azure synapse/data factory/adf
•   now lenox is stepping into cloud
•   Azure Synapse is used to gather data from different sources like D365, shopify


•   be active in meeting by giving proper responses after each instruction
•   be active to talk passively with other team members
•   speak efficiently with breaks




Understanding from today's client meeting:

Dashboard side:
working on azure specially on azure synapse
email
not using any encryption
2 firewall 
ip is static so need to use vpn sometimes
vpn coneection
try to connect vpn using any password(any like kishan)
mfa for login any DW, power bi
vpn we need duo sec.
        
duo and authenticator
login to powerbi with vpn to access DW like synapse DW pool
startup company 
using 30 years old system
now we are stepping into cloud
someone don't know about cloud
we have access
1 ip we have static and sometime it may be down, that time we need vpn.
once we have lenox ip then we can 
we are using azure devops, need permission
vpn setup needed

catalog enhancement and datalake side.

Lenox Data Warehouse:
    Repos: azure synapse/data factory/adf -> proposed architecture as they want to understand first(prepare model/ scalable architecture)

        Azure Synapse:
            use it to gather data from different sources like D365, shopify
