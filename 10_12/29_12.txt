🎚 3. Filters Pane
The Filters Pane controls how data is filtered at different report levels.

Filter Types:

Visual-level Filters: Apply filters to a single chart or visual.
Page-level Filters: Apply filters across all visuals on the current report page.
Report-level Filters: Affect the entire report across multiple pages.


Split Columns








 Cross Filtering Direction:
 Example: Single vs. Both
Scenario: You have a Customers table and an Orders table, linked by Customer ID.
Single: Clicking a customer shows their orders. Clicking an order doesn't automatically show their customer details in a customer list (unless you filter the list separately).
Both: Clicking a customer shows their orders, AND clicking an order automatically highlights or filters the customer in the customer list, and vice-versa. 










DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) 

Sum:
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Amount])

SumX:
Total Revenue = SUMX(Sales, Sales[Quantity] * Sales[Price])
